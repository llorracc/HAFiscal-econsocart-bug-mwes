Font Shape Bug Demonstration
C HRISTOPHER C ARROLL
Johns Hopkins University, NBER, and econ-ark.org
This minimal document demonstrates a font shape error in the econsocart.cls
document class when using small caps combined with italic emphasis.

1. T HE P ROBLEM
This paragraph contains normal text. Now we demonstrate the bug:
This text uses SMALL CAPS and this uses italic, but combining them as small caps
italic causes:
LaTeX Error: Font T1/put/m/scit/12 not found
The error occurs because the Utopia font (T1/put) does not define the scit font
shape (small caps + italic combined).
2. A DDITIONAL P ROBLEMATIC C OMBINATIONS
The following font shape combinations are also undefined:
• scit: small caps + italic → fails here
• scsl: small caps + slanted → fails here
• slit: slanted + italic → fails here
3. E XPECTED VS . ACTUAL B EHAVIOR
Expected: LaTeX should either:
1. Provide the combined font shape, or
2. Silently substitute a close approximation
Actual: Compilation fails with an error, preventing document generation.
